# Snipd Podcasting App - Cloned on Expo Snack
Saw an app on the Flutter showcase website and decided to build it in React Native. Snipd is a podcasting mobile app developed with Flutter, this is my React Native cloned version(not the full app clone, just the home interface).


## How to run this on your local development
- Download zip or 'git clone <link to repo>

- Open terminal, make sure your current working directory is in the downloaded/cloned folder.

- Install `node_modules/` with `'npm install'`

- Run `'npm start'` to start expo local server 

- Scan QR code or run on Android or iOS simulator on your local machine.



# Fork
Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://twitter.com/expo) or ask in our [forums](https://forums.expo.io/c/snack).

Snack is Open Source. You can find the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/expo/snack).
